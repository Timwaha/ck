In our project, we plan to use MOOD metrics, including Method Hiding Factor (MHF)ï¼Œ Attribute Hiding Factor (AHF), Method Inheritance Factor (MIF), Attribute Inheritance Factor(AIF), Coupling Factor (CF) and Polymorphism Factor (PF) to validate our hypotheses. We also plan to use the metrics, including Number of Child (NOC), Coupling Between Objects (CBO), Response For a Class (RFC), to measure the software we choose. We will compute these metrics on 26 versions of open source project jEdit.
